                    <p>Netflix</p>
                        <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">netflix.com</a>

                                    <p>As soon as you visit Netflix, you will read "Unlimited movies, TV shows, and more" gives you a brief summary or shows you the important aspect of the website. It is in bold because it is the most important part or concept of their company. The text is in white which is in contrast to the background which is darker. The "Get Started" button too is in red to signify urgent or I think it just pops out. You simply couldn't miss that red button.</p>

                                    <p>When you visit Spotify, they have a number of plan selections to choose from; which cater to different needs. So it gets you thinking, which plan would work with me? Wait, this plan has this while this plan has this. Making you spend a longer time in their website to make a decision. It makes you weigh in the cons and the pros for each plan.</p>

                                    <p>Fitt's law is applied here because as soon as you open Kajabi, you are immediately greeted by a big button to try their service. It is readily available at their front page. In mobile view, it is so large that its hard not to miss it.</p>
